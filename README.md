# trine2browser
Very hacky online game browser for Trine 2.
My understanding of the protocol is very limited because I reverse engineered the bare minimum for this to work.

I wrote this mostly as an excuse to play around with PySide2 and Python in general.
So I may extend this useless thing with even more useless features, just because it is my current learning project.
